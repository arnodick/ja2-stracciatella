  title: Strategic Map Underground Sector
  description: |
    Defines the underground sectors that can be occupied by enemies, creatures,
    etc. It also contains the network of cave connections critical for strategic
    creature spreading, as we can't know how the levels connect without loading
    the maps. Any changes to the maps, require changes accordingly.

    Number of enemies and variances are specified as array of integer, in the
    form of [ n_EASY, n_MEDIUM, n_HARD]. defaults to [0,0,0] if not given.

    Variances can be specified to add per-game randomness. It is specified as
    arrays of integers: [ var_EASY,  var_MEDIUM, var_HARD ]. Also defaults to
    [0,0,0] if not given.

    The formula to calculate the number of enemies is:
       ( n_DIFLEVEL + Random(var_DIFLEVEL) )
    where Random is a function returning a random number between 0 and
    (var_DIFLEVEL - 1) inclusively.
