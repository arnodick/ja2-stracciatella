    Definitions of player-controllable transport vehicle.

    The ordering in this list is important, and the game has hard-coded references to the
    vehicles. For example, the game expects the HELICOPTER to be the 6th vehicle.

    In base vanilla game, only the Hummer, Ice-cream truck and Helicopter are available.
