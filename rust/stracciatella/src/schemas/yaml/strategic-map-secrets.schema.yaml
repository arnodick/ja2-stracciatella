  title: Strategic Map Secret
  description: |
    A secret facilitiy or town that is not known at game start. Once it is found, an indicator
    icon is displayed on the strategic map. Secrets can be found by a quest event, or by visiting the sector.

    The sector short description (or the "land type string") is changed and a map icon is added when the secret is found.

    Note that only the first 2 non-SAM secrets are persisted in saves to maintain vanilla save compatability. The base
    vanilla game has TIXA as the first and ORTA as the second map secret, followed by 4 secret SAM sites.

    The number of elements and the ordering is important. Changing these may make previous saved games unusable.
  properties:
    sector:
      title: Sector
      description: The sector where the facility is located. This is used as a key, so one sector can only have at most one secret, so this must be unique within the list
      $ref: types/sector-id.schema.yaml
    secretMapIcon:
      title: Secret map icon
      description: The path to the icon to display on the strategic map, after the secret is found. If skipped, there will be no icon on the map. Not used for SAM sites, as they are handled differently.

    secretLandType:
      title: Secret land type
      description: The land type shown in strategic map before the secret is found. See strategic-map-traversibility-ratings for the available types.
