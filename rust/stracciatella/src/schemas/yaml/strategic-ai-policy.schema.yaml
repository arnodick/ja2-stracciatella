  Game policies governing Strategic AI behaviour.

  Most of the settings here are set at the start of a campaign. Changes will only take
  effect in a new game.
properties:
  queens_pool_of_troops_easy:
    title: Queens Pool of Troops Easy
    description: |
      Modifies the number of troops the queen has at the beginning of the game on top of
      all of the garrison and patrol groups.  Additionally, there are a total of 16 sectors
      that are LEVEL 1, 2, or 3 garrison groups.  The lower the level, the more troops stay
      in that sector, and the rest will also be used as a secondary pool when the primary
      pool runs dry.  So basically, this number is only part of the equation.

      Vanilla value: `150``

  enemy_starting_alert_level_easy:
    title: Enemy starting alert level easy
    description: |
      Sets the starting alert chances.  Every time an enemy arrives in a new sector, or the 
      player, this is the chance the enemy will detect the player in adjacent sectors. This
      chance is associated with each side checked.  Stationary groups do this check 
      periodically.

      Vanilla value: `5`

  enemy_starting_alert_decay_easy:
    title: Enemy starting alert decay level easy
    description: |
      When an enemy spots and chases a player group, the alertness value decrements by this
      value.  The higher the value, the less of a chance the enemy will spot and attack
      subsequent groups.  This minimizes the aggressiveness of the enemy.

      Ranges from 1 - 100 (but recommend 20-60).

      Vanilla value: `75`

    title: Grace period in hours easy
    description: |
      When a player takes control of a sector, don't allow any enemy reinforcements to enter

    title: Num aware battles easy
    description: |
      Certain conditions can cause the queen to go into a "full alert" mode.  This means that

      of enemy initiated battles occur.  The same variable is what is used to determine the
      free checks.

      Vanilla value: `1`
