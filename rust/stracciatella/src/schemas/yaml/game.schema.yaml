properties:
  extra_hotkeys:
    type: boolean
    title: Extra Hotkeys
    description: |

      - `alt+r` to reload
      - `ctrl+q` to swap hand items
      - `shift+j` to climb through open window

      Vanilla setting: `false`
  can_enter_turnbased:
    type: boolean
    title: Can enter turnbased
    description: |
      Press d in realtime mode to manually start turn based mode.

      Vanilla setting: `false`

    type: boolean
    title: Middle mouse button look
    description: |
      Enables middle mouse button to trigger a look into cursor direction.

      Vanilla setting: `false`
  draw_item_shadow:
    type: boolean
    title: Draw item shadow
    description: |

      Vanilla setting: `true`
  target_fps:
    type: number
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 144
    title: Target FPS
    description: |
      Specifies how often the game tries to refresh the screen. Lower values reduce
      power consumption, higher values can make the game appear to be more responsive.

      Stracciatella default value: `40`
  game_durations_multiplier:
    type: number
    minimum: 0.25
    maximum: 4.0
    title: Game durations multiplier
    description: |
      Many of the game's predefined durations are multiplied by this value, including animations. This means
      that a value greater than 1 slows down the game, while values less than 1 speed it up. For example, the
      dot on the radar map blinks once every 400 milliseconds by default; with game_durations_multiplier set
      to 1.15 this would be slowed down to once every 460 milliseconds.

      Stracciatella default value: `1`
