        This should be a consecutive, non-branching, ordered list of underground sectors making up the lair, specified as an array of [sector, sectorZ, habitatType].
        
        This list should start with the innermost sector, which is the QUEEN_LAIR. The creatures will spread out outwards.
        Each sector must have a corresponding map file and defined in strategic-map-underground-sectors.json
        
        "habitatType" must be one of:

          - `QUEEN_LAIR`
