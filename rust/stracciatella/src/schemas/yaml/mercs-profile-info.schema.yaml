        What prices does this character get when buying or selling weapons?
        This is specified in percent of the normal price: when selling, the normal price is
        multiplied by 100 and divided by this value. When buying, the normal price is multiplied
        by this value, then divided by 100.
        In the original game, Flo is the only person who has an unique value.
